# Business_Website
<!-- For my website I decided to go for a more simple design. I had the colors of my website as different colors of greys. After I was done with my website I was going to go back a change them. After I was done I just decided to keep them because I thought they looked nice for the site. Because of making my website all grey it was hard to read certain things so I used borders and boxes to seperate it. In the navbar it was hard to tell the buttons apart so I added a | to make it easier to see the different buttons. In the gallery page I didnt really know what I was going to do with the descriptions for the pictures. They looked like I just randomly put them there. So, to fix that I changed the background color of the <p> to be a lighter grey and also I put a border around it and made it white so it would look better and more seperated. -->
